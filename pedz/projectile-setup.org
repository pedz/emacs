* Require leaf when compiling

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (eval-when-compile
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lib/leaf" user-emacs-directory))
    (require 'leaf))
#+end_src

* Projectile and helm-projectile

[[https://melpa.org/#/projectile][Projectile]] says "Manage and navigate projects in Emacs easily".  I was
introduced to it via LSP and ~lsp-mode~ and thus far I haven't used it
much.  I found [[https://melpa.org/#/helm-projectile][helm-projectile]] along the way and added it in too.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (leaf projectile
    :bind (:projectile-mode-map
           ("s-p" . 'projectile-command-map))
    :defun helm-projectile-on
    :require projectile helm-projectile
    :config (projectile-mode +1)
    (helm-projectile-on))
#+end_src

* Projectile Rails

[[https://melpa.org/#/projectile-rails][projectile-rails]] says "Minor mode for Rails projects based on
projectile-mode".  Again... just getting into it... Lets see how it
shakes out.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (leaf projectile-rails
    :after projectile
    :bind (:projectile-rails-mode-map
           ("s-r" . 'projectile-rails-command-map)))
#+end_src

* Provide ~projectile-setup~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (provide 'projectile-setup)
#+end_src
