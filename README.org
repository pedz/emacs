* Emacs Configuration

This is my new Emacs configuration based upon [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]]
techniques using [[https://orgmode.org][Org Mode]] formatting.

I am now using [[https://github.com/emacscollective/borg/blob/master/borg.el][borg]] instead of ~el-get~ for my package manager and
[[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/leaf.html][leaf]] for package configuration.

I've kept a lot of my old crap in either code that is not tangled or
stuffed away in the ~old~ directory.
